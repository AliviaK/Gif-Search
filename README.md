Advanced JavaScript final project

This application uses the Giphy and Fetch APIs to make fetch requests, utilizing JavaScript ES6 syntax and promises. This application was created for my Advanced JavaScript course final project for the purpose of practicing the cleanest modern syntax and handling APIs and various data types. Uploaded for portfolio viewing.
